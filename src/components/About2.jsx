                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hey, people!</p>
                <p>I believe you know that I am fond of clicking random pictures and travel to places that can make
                    anyone's heart beat a
                    little faster.</p>
                <p>This is how I am and all this fondness for capturing pictures of things or people or even a situation
                    was gifted to me
                    while I was still a kid.
                    Then I realised, I grew with a longing which isn't for a person or a thing. It's something far
                    more than that and I found that this craving can be satisfied by photography. </p>
                <p>Photography was my hobby, even when I was a kid I was fascinated by the pictures that I would come
                    across over the
                    internet or books or even newspapers.As I grew up, this hobby grew bigger and consumed more and more
                    of me.I became the guy who was never found in the group photo because being out of the frame was
                    something I loved.</p>
                <p>I always tried to put my perspective into a picture, to show the world a different way of looking at
                    things. So I
                    decided to turn this hobby into my passion as I wanted to do something in this field.</p>
                <p>But I needed a platform, a place where I could potray myself through my work.</p>
                <br />

                <p>And I found a perfect way to do that. So, presenting this page to you all. It contains my experience,
                    my perspective of
                    this world. Hope you guys love it. And would always love to hear your views.</p>
