    //             <p>Hey, people!</p>
    //             <p>I believe you know that I am fond of clicking random pictures and travel to places that can make
    //                 anyone's heart beat a
    //                 little faster.</p>
    //             <p>This is how I am and all this fondness for capturing pictures of things or people or even a situation
    //                 was gifted to me
    //                 while I was still a kid.
    //                 Then I realised, I grew with a longing which isn't for a person or a thing. It's something far
    //                 more than that and I found that this craving can be satisfied by photography. </p>
    //                 <div><img src="../about-img/about1.jpg" alt="pro-pic" /></div>

    //             <p></p>
    //             <p>I always tried to put my perspective into a picture, to show the world a different way of looking at
    //                 things. So I
    //                 decided to turn this hobby into my passion as I wanted to do something in this field.</p>
    //             <p>But I needed a platform, a place where I could potray myself through my work.</p>
    //             <br />

    //             <p>And I found a perfect way to do that. So, presenting this page to you all. It contains my experience,
    //                 my perspective of
    //                 this world. Hope you guys love it. And would always love to hear your views.</p>
